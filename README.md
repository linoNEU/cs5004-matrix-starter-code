### Homework 3: Implementing the Matrix Interface

#### Objective:
In this assignment, you will implement the `Matrix` interface in a class called `MatrixImpl` and create extensive unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation. The `Matrix` interface defines a two-dimensional array of numbers and several operations that can be performed on matrices.

#### Grading:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:
- Correctness and completeness of the `MatrixImpl` class implementation
- Coverage and quality of unit tests
- Code readability and documentation
- Handling of edge cases and exceptions
